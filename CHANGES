3.0 - 2016-07-16
	Started a CHANGELOG to track major changes :-)
    Added a new validation step using the confdc compiler from the ConfD
	Management Agent available here:
	  https://developer.cisco.com/site/confD/downloads/
	This changes the output content to include new json payload elements
	and new output fields in the web interface.
