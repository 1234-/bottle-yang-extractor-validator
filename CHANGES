3.1 - 2016-07-22
  - Switched from 'confdc' to the 'yanger' compiler. Confdc actually uses
    yanger internally but adds ConfD-specific features, thus yanger is more
    appropriate as a general parser and validator.

3.0 - 2016-07-16
  - Started a CHANGELOG to track major changes :-)
  - Added a new validation step using the confdc compiler from the ConfD
    Management Agent[1]. This changes the output content to include new JSON
    payload elements and new output fields in the web interface.
